# Timelines
UI for visualizing and manipulating temporal datasets.  Using React and D3.

## Purpose
There's a lack of a focused tool for managing amorphous historical data.  Primarily non-digitized historical data.  The goal here is to provide a useful interface for researchers and students to manage and visualize their own research.

## Usefulness
The kind of data this is meant to be useful for is non-digitized and non-centralized data/accounts of both ancient and modern historians.  Making it easier to apply the historical method, and potentially providing insights that may not be immediately apparent using traditional methods.
